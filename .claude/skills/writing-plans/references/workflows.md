# Writing Plans - Workflow Reference

## Overview
Complete implementation plans for multi-step tasks assuming the engineer has zero context for the codebase. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Announce Skill Usage
- Announce at start: "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

### 2. Create Plan Document Header
Every plan MUST start with this header:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

### 3. Create Bite-Sized Tasks
Each step should be one action (2-5 minutes):
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

### 4. Task Structure Template
```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
```

### 5. Save Plan
Save plans to: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

### 6. Offer Execution Choice
After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:

**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

Which approach?"

## Key Principles
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits
